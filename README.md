# Fract-ol
``` diff
+ Similar repeated patterns
+ Similarity occurs at different scales
+ Leaf, trees, cauliflower, bronchial system, coast line
+ Set of complex numbers, imaginary numbers
```

## Project Description
- This project is about creating a small fractal exploration program. First, you have to know what a fractal is.
- You must use the MiniLibX. Either the version available on the school machines, or installing it using its sources.
- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not relink.
- Global variables are forbidden.

### Rendering
- Your program must offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
- The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer). This is the very principle of fractals.

 ### Graphic management
- Your program has to display the image in a window.
- Pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- Clicking on the cross on the windowâ€™s frame must close the window and quit the program in a clean way.
- The use of the images of the MiniLibX is mandatory.
